    <div id="intro">
        <p> Lice go back over 5 million years.  Even Cleopatra had her own golden lice comb.  The bottom line is they are here to stay.  They're very picky preferring to die rather than select any other host than human.  And they are so hearty that when threatened, they mutate.  Today's "super lice" can withstand pecsticides leaving us no choice but to comb and pick each and every nit from our infested darlnig's head.  Ugh. </p>

        <h2>Top Reasons I Hate Lice</h2>
        <ul class="reasons">
            <li>They always appear at the busiest times</li>
            <li>They require hours upon hours of extra laundry</li>
            <li>They lead to lots of lice combing related tears</li>
            <li>You must bag your child's stuffed lovey and so they now have
            trouble sleeping</li>
            <li>If you miss EVEN ONE they re-infest your home.</li>
            <li>If your child's best friend's MOM misses even one, they will
            re-infest your home.</li>
            <li> It is<a href="more_images.html"> the neverending story...!</a></li>
